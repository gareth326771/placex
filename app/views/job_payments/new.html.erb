          Customers can avoid getting stung by 'rogue' tradesmen by using Pay The Trade, any upstanding tradesman should agree to use the service! </br></br> Before starting a job payment agree terms with the tradesman, including any milestones when you will release money and be sure to write these down in case of disputes. Once agreed you can start a job by selecting 'Start Job Payment' on the Pay The Trade website and filling out the details.</br></br>  You will be required to pay the whole amount in and will need to add 1% (our customer fee) to the total. Once done, an email will be sent to the tradesman for them to set up an account and work can commence.</br></br>  Once you are happy with the work done you can release the money. In the event of a dispute please try and resolve with your tradesman in person however if agreement can not be reached, Pay The Trade will step in to help resolve it.
